        <h1><b>What Pine Barrens Is All About!</b></h1>
        <p>When taking a trip to Pine Barrens, people can go camping and all around are little back roads surrounded by woody areas. Some people when visiting, don’t realize that the New Jersey Devil exists, which makes the trip even more exhilarating. Camping in this <em>spooky</em> place alone is not a great idea, so take your family with you! If you are in for a <em>spooky</em> Halloween family trip, Pine Barrens, New Jersey is the best place to be. Anything is possible in these woods, so hopefully you can come back and tell me the story, and whether you encountered the <b>New Jersey Devil.</b></p>
